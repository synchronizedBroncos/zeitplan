Development notes

We developed this project using a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js).

Make sure to have node js installed. Once you clone this repository, you need to cd into the zeitplan folder and run the command npm install. This command installs all the dependencies.
Then you can start the project on your localhost using the command npm start

Some functionalilty is not going to work without having all the values in your .env file at the root.
